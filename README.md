# dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and config files for various tools and applications such as Alacritty, `tmux` or `nvim`.

The file structure corresponds to the structure of the local `$HOME` folder, hence a selective `rsync` into `$HOME` usually suffices to install all scripts.
